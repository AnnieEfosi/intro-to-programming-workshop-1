# Welcome to the Sonic Pi workshop!
# these are comments - this means text
# that will not affect the program.
# we can use them for memos, or instructions

# this is a variable
# we can assign a value to it
midi_note = 80

# this is a function.
# a function executes an action
play(80)

# there are other functions
# and we will see that we can write our own later
# we can use them without brackets if we want
sleep 1

# to run our code
# we use cmd-r on mac
# or alt-r on windows
# and alt-r on linux
# try that now.

# we can pass around variables
# and use them as the input to functions
# this means functions can do something with them
# like play a note
# remove the comment from the line below and run the code again:
# play(midi_note)
